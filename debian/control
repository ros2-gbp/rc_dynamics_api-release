Description: The rc_dynamics_api provides an API for easy handling of the dynamic-state data streams provided by Roboception's stereo camera with self-localization.
 See http://rc-visard.com Dynamic-state estimates of the rc_visard relate to its self-localization and ego-motion estimation. These states refer to rc_visard's current pose, velocity, or acceleration and are published on demand via several data streams. For a complete list and descriptions of these dynamics states and the respective data streams please refer to rc_visard's user manual.
